// Sticky weekly / monthly opportunity throughput counts.
//
// The problem (Luke, June): GHL exposes only an opportunity's CURRENT stage.
// "Offers this week" computed from a single snapshot = opps currently sitting
// at-or-past the Offer stage whose last stage change was this week. Because
// "Abandoned" and "Lost" are REAL pipeline stages in VPG (not just statuses),
// the moment a deal is moved there it leaves the Offer band and the weekly
// number SHRINKS (Anthony went 13 → 6). Luke wants throughput — "how many were
// put INTO the stage this week" — a number that only climbs during the period.
//
// The fix: a single snapshot can't recover that a now-Lost opp passed through
// Offer earlier this week, so we diff each run against the previous run's
// per-opp stage ranks (persisted in opp-state.json across deploys) and count
// UPWARD crossings into the Offer band (rank Offer..Closed) and the Contract
// band (rank UnderContract..Closed). Crossings accumulate; moving an opp out to
// Lost/Abandoned never decrements the count.
//
// Seeding & graceful degradation:
//   - The first run of a new week/month seeds the counter with the snapshot's
//     instantaneous breadcrumb count, so the board never visibly drops to zero
//     on deploy — it just stops shrinking from that point forward.
//   - A floor of max(sticky, breadcrumb) means we can never read BELOW today's
//     live behaviour, so this can't regress.
//   - Counts become fully accurate once a complete period of runs has accrued.
