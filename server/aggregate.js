  // --- opportunities — strict current-stage baseline for sticky ----------
  // Luke, Sept 14: "count as an offer only if it hits the stage 'Offer
  // Submitted'. It can then move out to any other stage but the number will
  // not decrease. Contract only counts when it hits 'Under Contract'."
  // Two-layer implementation to deliver that behaviour:
  //   1. This file emits a STRICT current-stage-only baseline: an opp counts
  //      as an offer only while its current stage is exactly Offer Submitted
  //      AND its lastStageChange is in the period. Same for contracts. That
  //      matches "the deal is at that stage right now, and got there this
  //      period" — no fanout to later stages, no updatedAt fallback.
  //   2. server/stickyCounts.js diffs each run against opp-state.json and adds
  //      any newly-crossed Offer / Contract band entries on top of prior
  //      totals. Once counted, an opp stays counted for the rest of the
  //      period — the sticky counter never decrements when a deal moves out.
  // Together: numbers climb monotonically through the period without any of
  // the pass-through-stage overcount problem (Luke's "58 contracts when it
  // should be much less").
